## Overview
W. Avy is planning to open a new surf and ice cream shop. He would like us to find more info about the temperature trends before he opens his shop to see if it can be a year around shop. To do this he wants us to look at June and December to see if the temperature is still in a good range to that ice cream would sell.
## Results
Three key differences in the temperature data between the months of June and December are:
- The biggest take away we got was that there was almost 2,000 more reading in June than there was in December.
    - June had 1,700 readings
    - December had 1,517 readings
- The temperatures are over lower in December than they are in June
  December's averager temp is around 71
  June's average temp is around 75

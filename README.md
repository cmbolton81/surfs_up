## Overview
W. Avy is planning to open a new surf and ice cream shop. He would like us to find more info about the temperature trends before he opens his shop to see if it can be a year around shop. To do this he wants us to look at June and December to see if the temperature is stiill in a good range to that ice cream would sell.
